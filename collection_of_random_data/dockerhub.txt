Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository service that acts as a central platform for storing, managing, and sharing Docker container images.
 It functions as a registry where developers can push (upload) and pull (download) container images over the internet, supporting both public and private repositories.
 This centralized storage enables consistent application deployment across different environments by encapsulating applications and their dependencies into self-contained units.

The platform provides a vast library of pre-built, ready-to-use container images for operating systems, frameworks, databases, and more, accelerating development workflows and reducing setup time.
 Developers can extend these images to create custom applications, build them locally, and then push them to Docker Hub for sharing with teams or the broader community.
 Docker Hub also supports automated builds by integrating with code repositories like GitHub and Bitbucket, allowing images to be rebuilt automatically when code changes are pushed
